# 📘 Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) – Java Experiments

This repository contains a collection of Java programs implemented as part of the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** laboratory.  
Each experiment demonstrates a core algorithmic concept such as searching, sorting, greedy methods, and graph algorithms.  
All programs are modular, efficient, and illustrate both the logic and design principles behind algorithm analysis.
